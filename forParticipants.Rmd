# for Participants Choosing to Share Data

## Participant Bill of Rights

As a person who shares information with Databrary, you have the right to:

  - Be free of pressure from anyone else when deciding if you wish to share information
  - Make up your mind about sharing information without being rushed
  - Have the decision to share information with Databrary be separate from the decision to participate in research
  - Be told what information is being shared with Databrary
  - Be told if there will be no direct benefit to you
  - Ask questions about Databrary at any time before, during or after you participate in a study or agree to share information
  - Refuse to share data without penalty
  - Ask to have your data removed from sharing on Databrary, without any penalty
  - Receive a copy of your Databrary release form for you to keep
  - Be assured that your identity will be kept in confidence by Databrary and its authorized researchers.
If I have any questions or concerns I can contact Databrary staff by email at ethics@databrary.org. I can also ask the staff from the study I participated in for help.
