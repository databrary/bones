## for Authorized Investigators

  - add a supervised user to my group/lab data
  - add a supervised user to all shared Databrary data
  - What if I leave my institution and no longer have Authorized Investigator Status?
  - What if I my institution requires me to submit an IRB just to access?  
      - Recommended Abstract language: The purpose of this application is to access the Databrary
(https://www.databrary.org/about/about-databrary.html), which is a digital data library specialized
for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video.
I do not currently have data to contribute to the library; however, I would like to have access to its
contents in order to browse the available data and potentially develop a research project. Once I have
a research proposal, I will submit a new protocol for IRB determination.  
    - Access to Identifiers:  I will have access to  elements of dates (except for year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date,  Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints, and
 Full face photographic images and any comparable images.  
    - Details: The purpose of this application is to access the Databrary
(https://www.databrary.org/about/about-databrary.html), which is a digital data library specialized
for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video. I would like to have access to its
contents in order to browse the data and potentially develop a research idea to submit for IRB
approval in a separate application.
  - When do I need to submit to the IRB to use secondary data? When you move from the preparatory to  research to the research phase. When you move from exploring the feasibility of a coding scheme to deciding to apply it systematically to a set of videos, that’s the transition point. That said, you must still protect the data during pre-research or research planning as you normally would for these sorts of data. That’s why we have the access agreement.
    
    Databrary Policy:  "Because video and audio recordings and photographs may depict faces, voices, names, or other
personally identifying information, special care must be taken. The principles of informed consent
enable participants to decide for themselves whether or not they will allow their data to be shared
with other researchers for other research purposes. The people depicted must give explicit
permission for the recordings or photographs to be shared with Databrary.
In other data formats such as text files and spreadsheets, participants must not be denoted by names
or initials. Personally identifying information must be removed before data are contributed."
