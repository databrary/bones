<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Overview of the Databrary Access Agreement</h2>
<p>The Databrary Access Agreement grants user and contributor privileges to all shared data in Databrary. Once the agreement is finalized, authorized investigator can access identifiable data that is shared. Below is a summary, but all details are located in documents located in the <a href="">Templates</a> and <a href="">Policies</a> sections</p>
<p>Approval for research involving human subjects is <strong>not</strong> required by Databrary in order to become an authorized investigator.</p>
<p>Institutions should remember that authorized investigators agree to seek whatever approvals are required by their institution for their use of Databrary. Typically, contributing data and conducting research using Databrary resources require institutional approval for research involving human subjects. However, many uses of Databrary are for pre-research or non-research purposes (e.g. browsing data for ideas, getting video clips for teaching or talks, learning about procedures or methods) and do not typically require institutional approval for research involving human subjects.</p>
<p>When Authorizing Investigators The institution confirms the eligibility of its investigators by:</p>
<p>Verifying that authorized investigators are eligible to conduct independent research at the institution. Validating that authorized investigators have research ethics training that meets the institution’s standards. The institution:</p>
<p>Maintains an ethics or institutional review board that reviews and approves research involving human subjects. Grants authorized investigators the responsibility to choose and manage affiliates who meet Databrary’s qualifications and who agree to follow Databrary’s ethical principles. The institution holds authorized investigators responsible for the conduct of affiliates they select. Accepts responsibility for its authorized investigator(s) actions related to the use of Databrary. Data Contribution and Use The institution:</p>
<p>Asserts that it has the rights to share with Databrary any data the authorized investigator contributes; no other entity or individual has ownership rights that prevent the authorized investigator from contributing data to Databrary. Agrees to allow use of the data exclusively for the purpose of scientific research or education under the auspices of an academic, research, government, health, or commercial entity (but in the last case, solely for non-commercial purposes unless allowed under the terms of a separate agreement). Agrees not to sell or trade data or use it for other commercial purposes. Grants each authorized investigator authority to decide when and with whom the authorized investigator wishes to share data, and the institution holds the authorized investigator responsible for the use of shared data. Agrees to follow all relevant national, state, and local laws and regulations that pertain to the use of research data. Confidentiality and Ethics The institution agrees to inform Databrary of any suspected violation of confidentiality or ethics. If Databrary determines that an authorized investigator at the institution has violated the terms of the Databrary Access Agreement or other Databrary policies, Databrary may remove the data in question and/or deny the authorized investigator or the institution access to Databrary, temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>Any violation may be reported to the official at the institution charged with handling violations of research ethics. The Institution may request information from Databrary about the authorized investigator’s use or their Affiliate’s use of the library.</p>
<p>If denied access to Databrary, authorized investigators or the institution may request a review.</p>
<p>Each party shall be responsible for its negligent acts or omissions and the negligent acts or omissions of its employees, officers, or director’s, to the extent allowed by law.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Rules for Ethics oversight vs. approval</h2>
<p>The Databrary Access Agreement is different from a traditional Data Use Agreement because there is no obligation for authorized investigators to use or to contribute data. Once our researchers are planning to share data from lab or repurpose shared data in a systematic way, they would seek proper IRB approval for those activities.</p>
<p>Here are our guidelines regarding ethics board involvement:</p>
<p>Ethics board <strong>oversight is required</strong> to join Databrary. In other words, your institution must have an IRB or human subjects research ethics board (REB).</p>
<p>Ethics board <strong>approval is NOT required</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for access to Databrary. In other words, just to browse.</p></li>
<li><p>to contribute data to Databrary that does not contain personally identifying information (PII). In other words, procedural videos, stims, coding files, analysis, computer codes, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ethics board <strong>approval IS required</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to re-use data from Databrary. In other words, to conduct secondary data analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>to contribute data to Databrary that contains personally identifying information (PII). In other words, videos containing participant faces, names, dates of birth, etc.</p></li>

<div id="working-with-your-irb" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Working with your IRB</h2>
<p>Some researchers view IRB concerns as an impediment to data sharing, even those researchers who understand the many benefits of sharing. Given the checkered history of psychological science with regard to respecting the rights of human participants, it is not surprising that not sharing data has been a generally acceptable practice. However, IRB concerns and recommendations around data sharing vary depending on the specific type of data being shared. Moreover, best practices for seeking informed consent are widely available, thereby properly protecting participants.</p>
<div id="types-of-data-sharing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Types of Data Sharing</h3>
<p>Different types and levels of data sharing are associated with different ethical concerns. It is useful to distinguish among different use cases, and the types of concerns raised around data sharing in developmental science.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-reuse" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Data reuse</h3>
<p>Using data shared by others (“secondary use”) usually involves low risk to participants because the new study does not involve contact with the participants. However, the level of risk depends on the nature of the data, whether the data are identifiable or otherwise sensitive, and the sort of permission that participants initially granted for sharing. Reuse of existing shared data is common practice, so most IRBs have established procedures for determining the level of risk posed by a particular project involving secondary use. For example, many IRBs deem exempt from review projects that involve the secondary use of non-sensitive, de-identified data.</p>
</div>
<div id="video-data-and-other-data-that-might-contain-identifiers." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> Video data and other data that might contain identifiers.</h3>
<p>What’s new, less common, and a potential source of concern to IRBs is the push by investigators under their supervision for more widespread sharing of certain types of data. This push means that PIs and their IRBs must evaluate the risks of sharing data within each particular study. Doing so requires determining what data can be shared, with whom and how, and with what level of risk. The risk of identification raises special concern. Fortunately, practices about what personal identifiers should be eliminated from data files are well established (even in brain imaging), so in many cases, de-identifying data files is uncomplicated. In cases where researchers seek to share sensitive or identifiable data (such as unaltered video or audio recordings that might contain participants’ faces, voices, or audible names), establishing guidelines on restriction of access is essential. Sharing these sorts of data increases risks to participants, and therefore explicit permission to share must be sought, with participants being fully informed of the meaning of “shared data” and who will have access.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-gets-access-and-where" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Who gets access and where?</h3>
<p>Choices about how PIs should share data and who should have access are complicated. PIs or IRBs may be under the mistaken impression that shared data should (or must) be publicly available to meet open science standards, or journal or funder mandates. In fact, some of the most successful examples of data sharing in developmental research involve restricted access, where data are stored in recognized data repositories that limit access to approved researchers. Public access may be appropriate for some datasets, but it should not be the standard to which all studies must be held.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="solutions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Solutions</h2>
<p>It is critical to seek explicit permission from participants to share data and to be transparent about the uses of those data. This honors participants’ autonomy by ensuring they (and/or their caregivers) fully understand the risks of sharing the data they contribute – as well as the potential benefits to science and the community at large that they are granting by sharing.</p>
<div id="capitalize-on-existing-resources." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Capitalize on existing resources.</h3>
<p>Developmental science has a long history of data sharing, and researchers can learn best practices from existing resources. In developing institution- or project-specific language for consents and data sharing permissions, PIs and IRBs can draw on the collective experience of experts and data repositories that have experience sharing data from vulnerable populations, such as children. Sources that provide valuable guidance about how to seek informed consent and data sharing permission, including template language, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.databrary.org/resources/policies.html">Databrary</a>;</li>
<li>Child Language Data Exchange System <a href="https://talkbank.org/share/irb/">(CHILDES)</a>;</li>
<li>Inter-university Consortium on Political and Social Research <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/confidentiality/conf-language.html">(ICPSR)</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Open Brain Consent</a> project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several of these organizations are collaborating on developing template language and data sharing procedures that will make these provisions even more consistent in the future.</p>
<p>Be ready with answers to IRB questions about data reuse. The IRB review plays a vital role in ensuring that standard consent, data management, and data sharing practices used for primary data collection enable future secondary uses while minimizing the risks to the original participants. Anticipating the questions that will be raised by IRBs and knowing how best to respond will enhance the likelihood of your IRB granting permission for data sharing. For example, in reviewing data sharing plans, IRBs may raise several practical questions that require an explicit response. For example:</p>
<p>Q. Must minors be re-consented when they reach the age of majority?</p>
<p>A. Federal officials say not if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods).</p>
<p>Q. Must data be destroyed after a particular time period?</p>
<p>A. Not if they are stored indefinitely in a recognized repository (as should become standard practice); data destruction is not mandated under federal regulations.</p>
<p>Request participant consent for sharing after their participation is complete. Because IRBs are concerned with participants being fully aware of what they are sharing, it is best practice to request participants’ consent to share after they have participated in a study, and therefore know exactly what data were gathered. Most developmental research is innocuous, and most parents are willing to share their children’s data – including video recordings – after they see that the project was fun and their children enjoyed participating. Most parents of children with disabilities are willing to share their children’s data because they hope to speed progress in research.</p>

<div id="when-do-i-need-to-submit-to-the-irb-to-use-secondary-data-from-databrary" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> When do I need to submit to the IRB to use secondary data from Databrary?</h2>
<p>You will need to submit to the IRB for secondary data use when you move from the preparatory to research to the research phase.</p>
<p>When you move from exploring the feasibility of a coding scheme to deciding to apply it systematically to a set of videos, that is when you would need to submit to the IRB. You must still protect the data during pre-research or research planning as you normally would for these sorts of data as outlined in the Databrary Access Agreement.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the following:</p>
<p>Is it Research?</p>
<p>Research is a “systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge” <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=83cd09e1c0f5c6937cd9d7513160fc3f&amp;pitd=20180719&amp;n=pt45.1.46&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML#se45.1.46_1102">(45 CFR 46.102(l))</a>.</p>
<p>Is it a Human Subject?</p>
<p>A human subject is “a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or (ii) obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens” <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=83cd09e1c0f5c6937cd9d7513160fc3f&amp;pitd=20180719&amp;n=pt45.1.46&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML#se45.1.46_1102">(45 CFR 46.102(e))</a>.</li>

<p>When you can answer YES to these two questions you need to submit to your IRB. If you are not sure, contact your IRB and they can help you.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.1</span> Consenting to participate is separate from releasing data for sharing</h3>
<p>Researchers should not worry that participants will decide not to enter a study because they are being asked to share their information. Consenting to participate in a study is an entirely separate decision for participants from giving permission to share their data. They can agree to participate in the study and choose to not release their data for sharing.</p>
<p>Because of this, we recommend that researchers introduce the Databrary Release after the recording–such as at the end of a session, visit, or longitudinal study. By asking participants about sharing with Databrary after the recording is finished, participants will know what was done during the session and have a clearer understanding of what they would be agreeing to share. Even this is entirely adaptable, as there may be other reasons that asking at the end is undesirable or infeasible.</p>
<p>The following considerations may apply when deciding when to introduce the Release:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the researcher would like to give participants the option to select which part or parts of the session to share, the form could be given at the end of each section. Alternatively, the form could be adapted to allow participants to answer about each section separately at the end of the entire session.<br />
</li>
<li>If there are activities or data of a sensitive nature in some portion of the session, the researcher may choose not to share that portion of the sessions. In this case, researchers may prefer to adapt the form to indicate that the sensitive portion will not be shared.</li>
<li>The data contributor can always choose not to share certain parts of the video even if the participant agreed to share them.</li>
<li>There may be some cases where it is simpler or necessary to offer the Databrary Release at the beginning of the study, such as in in classroom recordings or other group settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Databrary does <strong>not</strong> require contributors to have used the Databrary Release, or that researchers ask about sharing at the end.</p>

<p>Databrary requires all Databrary Authorized Investigators and Supervised Users to embrace best practices for data security.</p>
<div id="protect-confidentiality" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Protect Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Databrary contains identifying information, thus special care must be taken.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants should be identified by a code that does not include names, initials, birthdates, phone or ID numbers, etc.<br />
</li>
<li>Identifying information should be removed from text/flat files before it is shared with Databrary. -If you collect sensitive information on paper, lock the paper records in file cabinets and ensure that the file cabinets are located in locked rooms that are not readily accessible to unauthorized people.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="password-generation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Password Generation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use a unique password or passphrase for Databrary.<br />
</li>
<li>Do not share your password with others.<br />
</li>
<li>Choose a password that has capital and lower case letters, special characters and numbers and is long, greater than 10-12 characters.<br />
</li>
<li>Do not write your password down.<br />
</li>
<li>Do not store your password in an unencrypted file on your computer.<br />
</li>
<li>Change your password at least every 6 months.</li>

<div id="computers-used-to-access-and-download-databrary-files" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> Computers Used to Access and Download Databrary files</h2>
<ul>
<li>Computers should have individual-level, password-protected user accounts.<br />
</li>
<li>Computer account IDs or passwords should not be shared.<br />
</li>
<li>Computer account passwords should differ from those used for Databrary (see above).<br />
</li>
<li>Laptops may be stolen or lost, so it may be wise to enable system-wide file encryption.<br />
</li>
<li>Set your computer to activate a password protected screen saver after 3 minutes of inactivity.<br />
</li>
<li>Disable automatic log-in.<br />
</li>
<li>Set your computer to automatically logout after 5 minutes of inactivity.<br />
</li>
<li>Databrary logs the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of computers that access the system, so you may wish to choose a specific computer or computers to use to access Databrary.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="data-file-storage-and-backup" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> Data File Storage and Backup</h2>
<ul>
<li>If flat-file data are stored on laboratory computers, those computers should be regularly (daily or weekly) backed up to a secure location offsite.</li>
<li>More than one backup copy should exist. All backups should be secure.<br />
</li>
<li>Since Databrary stores high resolution copies of recordings that can be downloaded at any time, recordings taken from Databrary need not be backed up. Indeed, creating multiple backups of recordings from Databrary increases the risk that sensitive information may be released inadvertently.</li>

<div id="physical-features-of-laboratory-or-office" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.5</span> Physical features of laboratory or office</h2>
<ul>
<li>Laboratories or offices that house computers where data are stored should be locked whenever the rooms are unoccupied.<br />
</li>
<li>Laboratories or offices that house computers where data are stored should not be readily accessible to unauthorized people who are not supervised by a researcher.<br />
</li>
<li>Be aware of whether the layout of your laboratory or office inadvertently allows other individuals to see your computer screen or reflections from your computer screen through doors or windows.</li>

<div id="data-sharing-manifesto" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">14</span> Data Sharing Manifesto</h1>
<ul>
<li>Databrary’s primary purpose is to foster open data-sharing among a community of researchers in developmental science in particular, and in psychological and neural science more generally.</li>
<li>Open data-sharing is entirely voluntary. Investigators choose whether to share, when to share, and what to share. Databrary hopes that most Investigators will choose to share, will share early on in the research process, and will share most or all of the information they have permission to share. But, there is no requirement to do so.</li>
<li>Some models for when to share are as follows:
<ul>
<li>At the end of the formal grant period of a federally funded project.</li>
<li>Within one year of the date an article is accepted for publication or appears (online or in print).</li>
<li>When an article is accepted for publication.</li>
<li>At the time of submission of an article for peer review.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The more investigators who share and the more information they share, the more the community of researchers will benefit, the more scientists will discover, and the more the public will benefit.</li>
<li>Investigators who use information shared by others should follow ethical principles.
<ul>
<li>They should cite resources contributed by other Investigators. Citation is an important currency of scholarly activity.</li>
<li>They should contribute data and analyses of their own to Databrary in a timely way. Not everyone has the resources to collect highly valuable data sets. But, secondary analyses of data sets should be shared and linked to their original sources.</li>
<li>Investigators who use datasets contributed by others should consider contacting the data contributor when embarking on a new analysis of a contributed data set. It may also be appropriate to invite the data contributor to collaborate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Databrary encourages data from unpublished studies to be shared. In fact, Databrary provides an excellent home for them.</li>
