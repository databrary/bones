<h3>Rules for Ethics oversight vs. approval</h3>
<p>The Databrary Access Agreement is different from a traditional Data Use Agreement because there is no obligation for authorized investigators to use or to contribute data. Once our researchers are planning to share data from lab or repurpose shared data in a systematic way, they would seek proper IRB approval for those activities.</p>
<p>Here are our guidelines regarding ethics board involvement:</p>
<p>Ethics board <strong>oversight is required</strong> to join Databrary. In other words, your institution must have an IRB or human subjects research ethics board (REB).</p>
<p>Ethics board <strong>approval is NOT required</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for access to Databrary. In other words, just to browse.</p></li>
<li><p>to contribute data to Databrary that does not contain personally identifying information (PII). In other words, procedural videos, stims, coding files, analysis, computer codes, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ethics board <strong>approval IS required</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to re-use data from Databrary. In other words, to conduct secondary data analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>to contribute data to Databrary that contains personally identifying information (PII). In other words, videos containing participant faces, names, dates of birth, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Working with your IRB</h3>
<p>Some researchers view IRB concerns as an impediment to data sharing, even those researchers who understand the many benefits of sharing. Given the checkered history of psychological science with regard to respecting the rights of human participants, it is not surprising that not sharing data has been a generally acceptable practice. However, IRB concerns and recommendations around data sharing vary depending on the specific type of data being shared. Moreover, best practices for seeking informed consent are widely available, thereby properly protecting participants.</p>
<div id="types-of-data-sharing" class="section level4">
<h4>Types of Data Sharing</h4>
<p>Different types and levels of data sharing are associated with different ethical concerns. It is useful to distinguish among different use cases, and the types of concerns raised around data sharing in developmental science.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-reuse." class="section level4">
<h4>Data reuse.</h4>
<p>Using data shared by others (“secondary use”) usually involves low risk to participants because the new study does not involve contact with the participants. However, the level of risk depends on the nature of the data, whether the data are identifiable or otherwise sensitive, and the sort of permission that participants initially granted for sharing. Reuse of existing shared data is common practice, so most IRBs have established procedures for determining the level of risk posed by a particular project involving secondary use. For example, many IRBs deem exempt from review projects that involve the secondary use of non-sensitive, de-identified data.</p>
</div>
<div id="video-data-and-other-data-that-might-contain-identifiers." class="section level4">
<h4>Video data and other data that might contain identifiers.</h4>
<p>What’s new, less common, and a potential source of concern to IRBs is the push by investigators under their supervision for more widespread sharing of certain types of data. This push means that PIs and their IRBs must evaluate the risks of sharing data within each particular study. Doing so requires determining what data can be shared, with whom and how, and with what level of risk. The risk of identification raises special concern. Fortunately, practices about what personal identifiers should be eliminated from data files are well established (even in brain imaging), so in many cases, de-identifying data files is uncomplicated. In cases where researchers seek to share sensitive or identifiable data (such as unaltered video or audio recordings that might contain participants’ faces, voices, or audible names), establishing guidelines on restriction of access is essential. Sharing these sorts of data increases risks to participants, and therefore explicit permission to share must be sought, with participants being fully informed of the meaning of “shared data” and who will have access.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-gets-access-and-where" class="section level4">
<h4>Who gets access and where?</h4>
<p>Choices about how PIs should share data and who should have access are complicated. PIs or IRBs may be under the mistaken impression that shared data should (or must) be publicly available to meet open science standards, or journal or funder mandates. In fact, some of the most successful examples of data sharing in developmental research involve restricted access, where data are stored in recognized data repositories that limit access to approved researchers. Public access may be appropriate for some datasets, but it should not be the standard to which all studies must be held.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="solutions" class="section level3">
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>It is critical to seek explicit permission from participants to share data and to be transparent about the uses of those data. This honors participants’ autonomy by ensuring they (and/or their caregivers) fully understand the risks of sharing the data they contribute – as well as the potential benefits to science and the community at large that they are granting by sharing.</p>
</div>
<div id="capitalize-on-existing-resources." class="section level3">
<h3>Capitalize on existing resources.</h3>
<p>Developmental science has a long history of data sharing, and researchers can learn best practices from existing resources. In developing institution- or project-specific language for consents and data sharing permissions, PIs and IRBs can draw on the collective experience of experts and data repositories that have experience sharing data from vulnerable populations, such as children. Sources that provide valuable guidance about how to seek informed consent and data sharing permission, including template language, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.databrary.org/resources/policies.html">Databrary</a>;</li>
<li>Child Language Data Exchange System <a href="https://talkbank.org/share/irb/">(CHILDES)</a>;</li>
<li>Inter-university Consortium on Political and Social Research <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/confidentiality/conf-language.html">(ICPSR)</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Open Brain Consent</a> project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several of these organizations are collaborating on developing template language and data sharing procedures that will make these provisions even more consistent in the future.</p>
<p>Be ready with answers to IRB questions about data reuse. The IRB review plays a vital role in ensuring that standard consent, data management, and data sharing practices used for primary data collection enable future secondary uses while minimizing the risks to the original participants. Anticipating the questions that will be raised by IRBs and knowing how best to respond will enhance the likelihood of your IRB granting permission for data sharing. For example, in reviewing data sharing plans, IRBs may raise several practical questions that require an explicit response. For example:</p>
<p>Q. Must minors be re-consented when they reach the age of majority?</p>
<p>A. Federal officials say not if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods).</p>
<p>Q. Must data be destroyed after a particular time period?</p>
<p>A. Not if they are stored indefinitely in a recognized repository (as should become standard practice); data destruction is not mandated under federal regulations.</p>
<p>Request participant consent for sharing after their participation is complete. Because IRBs are concerned with participants being fully aware of what they are sharing, it is best practice to request participants’ consent to share after they have participated in a study, and therefore know exactly what data were gathered. Most developmental research is innocuous, and most parents are willing to share their children’s data – including video recordings – after they see that the project was fun and their children enjoyed participating. Most parents of children with disabilities are willing to share their children’s data because they hope to speed progress in research.</p>

<ul>
<li>Recommended Abstract language: The purpose of this application is to access the Databrary (<a href="https://www.databrary.org/about/about-databrary.html" class="uri">https://www.databrary.org/about/about-databrary.html</a>), which is a digital data library specialized for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video. I do not currently have data to contribute to the library; however, I would like to have access to its contents in order to browse the available data and potentially develop a research project. Once I have a research proposal, I will submit a new protocol for IRB determination.<br />
</li>
<li>Access to Identifiers: I will have access to elements of dates (except for year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints, and Full face photographic images and any comparable images.<br />
</li>
<li>Details: The purpose of this application is to access the Databrary (<a href="https://www.databrary.org/about/about-databrary.html" class="uri">https://www.databrary.org/about/about-databrary.html</a>), which is a digital data library specialized for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video. I would like to have access to its contents in order to browse the data and potentially develop a research idea to submit for IRB approval in a separate application.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When do I need to submit to the IRB to use secondary data? When you move from the preparatory to research to the research phase. When you move from exploring the feasibility of a coding scheme to deciding to apply it systematically to a set of videos, that’s the transition point. That said, you must still protect the data during pre-research or research planning as you normally would for these sorts of data. That’s why we have the access agreement.</p>
<p>Databrary Policy: “Because video and audio recordings and photographs may depict faces, voices, names, or other personally identifying information, special care must be taken. The principles of informed consent enable participants to decide for themselves whether or not they will allow their data to be shared with other researchers for other research purposes. The people depicted must give explicit permission for the recordings or photographs to be shared with Databrary. In other data formats such as text files and spreadsheets, participants must not be denoted by names or initials. Personally identifying information must be removed before data are contributed.”</p></li>

<h2>Data Sharing Manifesto</h2>
<ul>
<li>Databrary’s primary purpose is to foster open data-sharing among a community of researchers in developmental science in particular, and in psychological and neural science more generally.</li>
<li>Open data-sharing is entirely voluntary. Investigators choose whether to share, when to share, and what to share. Databrary hopes that most Investigators will choose to share, will share early on in the research process, and will share most or all of the information they have permission to share. But, there is no requirement to do so.</li>
<li>Some models for when to share are as follows:
<ul>
<li>At the end of the formal grant period of a federally funded project.</li>
<li>Within one year of the date an article is accepted for publication or appears (online or in print).</li>
<li>When an article is accepted for publication.</li>
<li>At the time of submission of an article for peer review.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The more investigators who share and the more information they share, the more the community of researchers will benefit, the more scientists will discover, and the more the public will benefit.</li>
<li>Investigators who use information shared by others should follow ethical principles.
<ul>
<li>They should cite resources contributed by other Investigators. Citation is an important currency of scholarly activity.</li>
<li>They should contribute data and analyses of their own to Databrary in a timely way. Not everyone has the resources to collect highly valuable data sets. But, secondary analyses of data sets should be shared and linked to their original sources.</li>
<li>Investigators who use datasets contributed by others should consider contacting the data contributor when embarking on a new analysis of a contributed data set. It may also be appropriate to invite the data contributor to collaborate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Databrary encourages data from unpublished studies to be shared. In fact, Databrary provides an excellent home for them.</li>
