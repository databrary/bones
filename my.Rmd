# Comments

- (TODO:Swapnaa) Is this what we've been calling the landing page ([LandingLoggedIn](LandingLoggedIn.html)) or 'dashboard', or is it the [myProjects](myProjects.html) page? 
Also, `img/myProjects2a_regular.png` did not get pushed to the repo. 
I commented this out so the site will render.
Can we link to draw.io URLs?
Finally, did you delete the landing page for newly registered (landingNoAuth, landingAuth) users?
- If this is the 

First-time users will see this:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("img/myProjects2a_firsttime.png")
```

Users with under 5 projects will see this:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
